# poetry-visualisation

## To fix:
- empty lines have blocks
- space at the end of word creates a block 
- part of speach recognition doesn't work

## To add:
- colour for poem by default
- add a set of default poems and a button for random selection for visualisation
- save colour *for the poem*
- rhyme visualisation
