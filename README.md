# poetry-visualisation

## To fix:
- empty lines creates a block in visualisation
- space at the end of a line creates a block in visualisation
- part of speach recognition doesn't work

## To add:
- colour for poem by default 
- add a set of default poems and a button for random selection for visualisation
- save colour *for the poem* 
- find the most common colour chosen for the poem and show it (?)
- rhyme visualisation
